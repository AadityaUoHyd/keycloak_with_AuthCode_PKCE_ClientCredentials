# keycloak_with_AuthCode_PKCE_ClientCredentials

- Here, keycloak is implemented to secure 3 types of projects. (All 3 in 1 project. i.e. multi-model maven project)
1. server-side rendered type (in this project spring mvc with thymeleaf is being used), 
2. pkce(Proof Key for Code Exchange) type for public client such as angular here, and 
3. client-credentials(B2B) for marchine-to-machine(Micoservice1 to Microservice2).
