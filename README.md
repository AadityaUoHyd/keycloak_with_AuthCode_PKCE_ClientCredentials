# keycloak_with_AuthCode_PKCE_ClientCredentials

- Here, keycloak is implemented to secure 3 types of projects. (All 3 in 1 project. i.e. multi-model maven project)
1. Authorization-Code for server-side rendered type (in this project spring mvc and thymeleaf are used), 
2. Authorization-Code with PKCE(Proof Key for Code Exchange) type for public client such as angular here, and 
3. Client-Credentials(B2B) for marchine-to-machine(One Micoservice to another Microservices).

4. Password-Credentials type has been implemented erstwhile, find it here: https://github.com/AadityaUoHyd/basicKeycloakDemo
